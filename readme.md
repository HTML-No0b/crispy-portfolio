## Portfolio About My Web Development
    ⁃ What motiviated me to create this project was making my own portfolio literally from scratch, then being
    able to see my work show while also showing off my skills.

    ⁃ I built this project not only to practice my skills in web design, but to understand what goes behind
    CSS and HTML. With the fruit of what makes those two work. I'm able to use this site to 
    help potential employers (or friends) to explore my site.
